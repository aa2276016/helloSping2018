# Create a class called MissManners that promotes politeness among our objects. 
# A MissManners object takes another object on construction. It has one method, called ask. 
# It responds by calling methods on the object it contains, but only if the caller said please first.

# We can also compose multiple instances of MissManners objects upon each other (see double_fussy in doctests). 
# A multilevel MissManners object must be politely requested to ask its own MissManners object. 
# This continues until we reach the bottom level MissManners object.

# Hint: Use getattr (Python docs) and hasattr (Python docs) to access methods using strings. 
# You may want to search online for some examples of their usage.

# Hint: Your implementation will need to use the *args notation that allows functions to take a flexible number of arguments. 
# If you need a refresher, take a look at your implementation of make_averaged in the Hog project
